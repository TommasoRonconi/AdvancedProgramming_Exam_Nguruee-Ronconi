\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Exam requests: 

1. Write a class PostcardList that satisfies the tests (defined using unittest). 

SPECIFICATIONS: 
Class PostcardList reads/writes Postcard messages from/to a properly formatted file: each record (i.e., file's line) is a Postcard. 
The Postcard format is "date:$(DATE); from:$(SENDER); to:$(RECEIVER);" (e.g., "date:2009-12-24; from:Daisy; to:Donald;"). For the sake of simplicity, the message is not considered.

Class PostcardList must have at least these attributes:
 - _file: file name, eventually with the full path.
 - _postcards: list of postcards read from _file.
 - _date: is a dict where the key is the string date, and the value is a list of indices. Each index refers to the corresponding record.
 - _from: is a dict where the key is the string sender, and the value is a list of indices. Each index refers to the corresponding record.
 - _to:   is a dict where the key is the string receiver, and the value is a list of indices. Each index refers to the corresponding record.

Class PostcardList must manage the I/O file through the following member functions. Note that you are free to choose the appropriate arguments, but the function names must be as follows:  
 - writeFile(self,...): write self.{_date,_from,_to} to self._file  
 - readFile(self,...): from self._file read self.{_date,_from,_to}    
 - parsePostcards(self,...): parse self._postcards, set self.{_date,_from,_to} 
 - updateFile(self,...): as write but appending to self._file 
 - updateLists(self,...): as read but appending to self._postcards 
 - getNumberOfPostcards(self): returns length of self._postcards

Class PostcardList must manage the sorting of dates/senders/receivers. Note that the names and arguments of the functions are fixed as follows: 
 - getPostcardsByDateRange(self,date_range): returns the postcards within a date_range
 - getPostcardsBySender(self, sender): returns the postcards from a sender
 - getPostcardsByReceiver(self, receiver): returns the postcards to a receiver
