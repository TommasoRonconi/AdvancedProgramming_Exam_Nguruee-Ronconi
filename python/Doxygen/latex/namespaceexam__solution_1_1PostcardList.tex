\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}@author Herbert Nguruwe and Tommaso Ronconi

Intresting notes:
Initially the  class was implemented using the defaultdict class 
from collections  package. This caused  problems with the method test
(test_check_sent_received_when)which is implemented using try-catch 
statement, so defaultdict doesn't return an error when  trying to 
access  an item that is not there it creates a new item. In this 
case it would create an empty list rather than throwing an exception.

All other functions passed the test.Defaultdict takes a type to initialize
as a default type.\end{DoxyVerb}
