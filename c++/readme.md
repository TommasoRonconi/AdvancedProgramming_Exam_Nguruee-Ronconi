# C++ assignment
## Herbert Nguruwe, Tommaso Ronconi

In this assignment we are required to implement a **binary search tree**.
The directory is structured as follows:
- the header files are contained in the directory [include](include) while the files with the definition of the templated functions are in the directory [tpl](tpl);
- the directory [Doxygen](Doxygen) contains the doxygen configuration file;
- the directories [input](input) and (analysis)[analysis] contain some support files used for testing and analyzing the functionalities of our application;
- [output](output) directory stores the results gathered from the analysis.

To compile the application type `make` from the root directory, it will generate an executable `tree.x` that takes no command line arguments and basically does nothing.

Two pre-processor variables are provided and can be included by means of the command `make`.
By typing
```bash
make OPT+=-DTEST
```
a testing version of the application will be compiled, it calls some of the most relevant functions implemented, we used this command for a quick response from the modifications made while implementing the code.

By compiling with
```bash
make OPT+=-DPERFORMANCE
```
a version of the application for testing the performances of the `find` function is compiled.
It takes `(int)KEY (double)VALUE` couples from `stdin` and inserts them into an object of our `class Tree` and into an object of type `std::map`.
It then measures the time necessary for searching the number 42.
The search is done
- on the unbalanced tree;
- on the tree balanced by means of the public function `balance` of the class;
- on the `std::map`
To ease a quick use we provide two input files for testing:
- [ordered_int-random_double.dat](input/ordered_int-random_double.dat) contains 50 consecutive integers coupled with random floating point numbers;
- [ordered_int-random_double.dat](input/random_int-random_double.dat) contains 50 couples of integer and floating point values, both in random order.

To run the test, first compile with flag `-DPERFORMANCE` then run the following one-liner:
```bash
cat input/random_int-random_double.da | ./tree.x
```
It will output three numbers corresponding to the time in nanoseconds taken by the find function in the unbalanced tree, in the balanced tree and in the `std::map`, respectively.

The complete documentation of the public functions implemented can be generated by typing
```bash
make documentation
```
The index file is put in folder `Doxygen/html/index.html`.
